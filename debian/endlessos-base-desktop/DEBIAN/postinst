# HACK: this was to get around the fact that the installer for 1.0.15 needs the endless_post_install script exist.
# It was moved from the endless desktop to the endless installer so the filename changed but the existing auto 
# update installer still expects the file to exist.
# Remove this in v1.0.18+
